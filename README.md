# data-structure-tasks

Task for now

1. Use python to implement the max-heapify verbatim from the slide.
2. Implement a graph using an adjacency list. Use classes to model Graph and Nodes.

Tasks for interns

1. Implement max-heapify from the slide in an iterative fashion.
2. Implement a function called heapify which changes a list to a heap order.
3. Read about heapsort
4. Use your function to implement a heap sorting mechanism.
5. Parse the file cities.txt to build a graph using the graph class you have modeled
6. Implement both breadth first search and depth first search. It is a plus if you implement DFS recursively. It should print a path between two cities.

NB

- Use python for your implementation and send your repo via an email
- Add docstring comments to your implementations
