# data-structure-tasks

Task for now
Use python to implement the max-heapify verbatim from the slide.
Implement a graph using an adjacency list. Use classes to model Graph and Nodes.

Tasks for interns
Implement max-heapify from the slide in an iterative fashion.
Implement a function called heapify which changes a list to a heap order.
Read about heapsort
Use your function to implement a heap sorting mechanism.
Parse the file cities.txt to build a graph using the graph class you have modeled
Implement both breadth first search and depth first search. It is a plus if you implement DFS recursively. It should print a path between two cities.

NB
Use python for your implementation and send your repo via an email
Add docstring comments to your implementations
